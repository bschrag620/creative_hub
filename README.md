The purpose of this app is to track users and equipment usage for a non-profit.

Equipment has certifications that must be met before a user has access to use the equipment.

Certifications have test(s) that must be taken and passed for the user to be granted the certification.

Once certified, users can visit the equipment page to "begin use". In reality, the intent is for users to have a badge that can be scanned at a station near the equipment. The station can make the get request to see if the user is certified, and if so unlock the equipment for use.

There is also personnel levels to users (none, volunteer, admin). The admin level has access to all users certifications and can override. Admins also have access to "reports" such as gathering all users that are volunteers and certified in CNC, for example, to help teach a class on it.
